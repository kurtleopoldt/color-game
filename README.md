# color-game
A simple html/css/javascript color guessing game.

The initial files were created during Colt Steele's ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"]("https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/") course on Udemy.

Planned improvements include:

- ~~add hexadecimal~~ 
- add hsla and rgba colors
- refactor using modules
- extend to include complementary / secondary colors after initial game complete?
